This is a linear regression example created to provide insights how a linear regression algorithm works.

We create some random data and try to fit it in a linear model using SGD backpropagation

Note:
Plotting works only for 1d data, so I restricted myself to 1d feature vector, so plotting for multiple features will throw up an error!
